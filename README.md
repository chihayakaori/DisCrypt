# Getting Started with the Program

To begin, please open the `yaml` file using a text editor and configure it according to the instructions included within the file. If you don't have an encryption key, feel free to leave the default value, the program will generate a key for you automatically. 

**Important Note :** In secure communication, encryption keys are vital. If your friends or community members don't have the same encryption key as you, they can't read your messages. Similarly, you won't be able to read their messages without their key.

Additionally, please note that if your bot lacks the necessary permissions in a channel, it will not be able to send or retrieve messages. This is an expected behavior, but I want to emphasize it nonetheless.

## Commands Overview

Several commands are available in the GUI. Simply type `$help` to view a list of commands, along with explanations of what each command does. 

## Media Handling in the GUI

In the GUI, you can view not only the messages but also the images, whether they are encrypted or not, as they will be automatically decrypted. Please note that only the path to the videos will be displayed in the GUI, as the videos themselves cannot be shown. All decrypted multimedia files will be downloaded to the folder labeled "CryptM" (images, videos, or other types of files). 

Please be aware that the bot ignores embeds sent by bots. Therefore, if you request to retrieve two messages from a channel and do not receive one of them, it's possible that the missing message is an embed.
